# üö¶ Road Accident Data Analysis using SQL

## üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Road Accident data using SQL. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify accident patterns, and recommend safety improvements using SQL queries, including aggregation, date functions, window functions, and CASE statements.

|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Accident_ID    | Unique Accident ID                   |
| Accident_Date  | Date of Accident                     |
| Location       | Accident Location                    |
| Severity       | Accident Severity (Minor, Severe, Fatal) |
| Casualties     | Number of Casualties                 |
| Vehicle_Count  | Number of Vehicles Involved          |
| Weather        | Weather Condition                    |
| Reason         | Cause of Accident                    |

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ VEHICLE_INFO

| Column Name    | Description                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Vehicle_ID     | Unique Vehicle ID                    |
| Accident_ID    | Linked Accident ID                   |
| Vehicle_Type   | Type of Vehicle                      |

## üîß SQL Techniques Used

- Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Date Functions (EXTRACT, TO_CHAR)
- CASE Statements (Severity Classification)
- Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, COUNT OVER)

---Conclusion Slide Text
Through this SQL-based Road Accident Data Analysis, we successfully extracted meaningful insights from the dataset using:

*Sunday recorded the highest number of accidents, indicating possible weekend risk factors such as increased travel and leisure driving.

*Foggy weather was identified as a major environmental factor contributing to accidents, highlighting the role of poor visibility in accident occurrence.
